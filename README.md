# Beamer-A LaTeX class for producing presentations
##Quick tutorial on using Beamer

Beamer allows you to create slides featuring overlays, animation and so on in LaTeX. You simply insert some calls to Beamer macros in your LaTeX source file, then run pdflatex. You then use Acrobat Reader (or xpdf etc.) to present your slides.

This document is intended as a quick tutorial on using Beamer. It's certainly enough to get you started, and the features presented here may be all you ever need. However, after you get comfortable with these features, there are tons of other ones which Beamer offers-its user [manual](http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf) is more than 200 pages long!

Note: 
- the  KU_Leuven.png and bottom.jpg are used for the template
- the dragon.jpg, video.m4v and video2.m4v are used in the presentation. You do not have to download them, just substitute them with your own videos and figures.
