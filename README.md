# Beamer-A LaTeX class for producing presentations
##Quick tutorial on using Beamer

Beamer allows you to create slides featuring overlays, animation and so on in LaTeX. You simply insert some calls to Beamer macros in your LaTeX source file, then run pdflatex. You then use Acrobat Reader (or xpdf etc.) to present your slides.

This document is intended as a quick tutorial on using Beamer. It's certainly enough to get you started, and the features presented here may be all you ever need. However, after you get comfortable with these features, there are tons of other ones which Beamer offers--its user [manual](http://mirror.ox.ac.uk/sites/ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf) is  more than 200 pages long!
